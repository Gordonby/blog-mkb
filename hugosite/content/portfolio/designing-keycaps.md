## Initial design

Mock up the layout, colourways, sizing and positions in [http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/)

## First render

Use KLE render to get a good first render of the board https://kle-render.herokuapp.com/

## Advanced rendering

Watch [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtAHb60JvfY&t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtAHb60JvfY&t=0s) then download [https://www.blender.org/](https://www.blender.org/)

You can convert your KLE json to a blender file with an AddOn : https://github.com/Kirpal/Keyboard-Layout-Editor-for-Blender

You will need to add/move/angle light sources and cameras to your scene in Blender, so prepare yourself for a learning curve.
