It can be a struggle to find good UK ISO keycaps...
<!--more-->
Getting keycaps for an ANSI board is really easy. There's a lot of options available.
With ISO boards however, the choice really narrows and half decent options end up costing a fortune.

Here's my round up of my favourite UK keycap sets, which hopefully will prove useful if you're in the UK looking for a new set üôÇ.

I opted for a colour blend of two of the Corsair sets (mint and glacier white), but kinda wish i'd just gone for the Blue Cat clones from AliExpress üòè

There is some hilarious debate on the [Corsair PBT DOUBLE-SHOT PRO Keycap page](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B097F11V9G) on Amazon. Several posts claiming that it is not a UK layout. You can clearly see from the image above that the Corsair keycaps work fine on a standard ISO TKL board. There are some of the older Corsair boards which feature a larger spacebar and smaller windows key where this set of keycaps is not appropriate.
The keyboard above is the Keychron K8 with a [standard layout](https://www.keychron.com/pages/keychron-k8-keyboard-keycaps-layout-and-keycap-size-hd-picture), the spacebar is 6.25u and the other bottom row keys are all 1.25u.
